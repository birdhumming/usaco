/*
given:
    int N cows
    for each cow: position, infected (1)/healthy (0)
do:
    there is a certain radius R such that any cow standing â‰¤ R units away from an infected cow will be infected.
    infected cows will then pass on the infection to any cows within R units. we don't know R.
    find the minimum possible number of cows that were initially infected.
note:
    FIRST! the only cows that exist are the ones we are given. there aren't a bunch of cows standing in a line one unit apart. 
    ex: (cow) (17 spaces) (cow) (2 spaces) (cow)
    2. realize that the only constraints we have on R are the positions of the uninfected cows. 
    because they are uninfected, the distance between them and the closest infected cows must be greater than R.
    3. for min number of starting cases, we want R to be as large as possible.
    4. combining 2 and 3: R must be small enough to ensure the uninfected cows but as large as possible
    R is the smallest distance between any uninfected cow and its adjacent infected cows. 
    5. also realize: for any number of infected cows in a row that are all less than R apart, the number of initial infections is 1.
    one cow infects another, and it is passed throughout the entire group. this is true no matter how big the group is.
